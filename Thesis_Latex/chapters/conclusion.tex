With the results found in this thesis, we have accurately described what kind of behavior is present about the non-smooth bifurcation when new mechanisms are introduced in both the one-dimensional model \eqref{eq:oneD_canonical} and Stommel model \eqref{eq:twoD_canonical}. The novelty of this work comes from the link between delayed tipping methods to the non-smooth Stommel model. This then paves the way for a more general approach to the broader class of non-smooth dynamical systems.

To describe a large class of observable behaviors, we considered the mixture of early bifurcation due to high oscillatory forcing with frequency $\Omega\gg 1$ and amplitude $A\sim O(1)$ as well as delayed tipping due to slow variation in the bifurcating parameter at rate $\epsilon\ll 1$. The main result being that these mechanisms have opposite effects on the tipping point and do mix with a kind of weighted average to produce an effective tipping approximation. These results give insight into the hysteresis behavior of the Stommel model and the less studied realm of non-smooth dynamics. The main approach used asymptotic expansions as well as the methods of multiple scales to identify reduced equations and to find asymptotic solutions to the models. We found that with oscillatory forcing, the reduced equations had a different expression depending on the relative size of the solution to the amplitude of oscillation. We also discovered that linking the slow variation $\epsilon$ and the frequency $\Omega$ gives important insight into how the system behaves. 

The methods developed for finding tipping points in the one-dimensional model \eqref{eq:oneD_canonical} gave good approximations with the numerical results. Due to the many similarities to the two-dimensional system \eqref{eq:twoD_canonical} we were able to modify the same analysis to find the tipping points here as well.

Future work would need to be done on cases where $\Omega\sim O(1)$ or smaller. This case is qualitatively different as slow oscillations may have dramatic contributions to the dynamics. This is also seen from the analysis where low frequency oscillations no longer allow for asymptotic expansions in terms of $\Omega^{-1}$ and no longer fall under our assumptions to integrate with $T_1$ and $T_2$. Thus this case behaves fundamentally different and can influence tipping in a way we hadn't explored here. This is shown in figure~\ref{fig:low_freq}. Also, large amplitude behavior $A>O(1)$ can force an additional rescaling before any familiar approaches hold. This is seen in figure~\ref{fig:large_amp}. These cases were mentioned but have yet to be performed on this model, although both have been studied around the smooth case in \cite{zhu2015tipping}. It is possible that they could have some surprising results in the non-smooth case. Together, these could help to further classify the tipping behavior for the variety of cases in real world ocean dynamics.

Lastly, we considered only deterministic behavior throughout this analysis but there are many reasons to incorporate stochastic elements into the Stommel model as well, see \cite{lorenzo2012role}. From \cite{zhu2015tipping} it is concluded that stochastic forcing has elements of both early bifurcations and delayed tipping and thus a natural follow-up to the analysis in this thesis. We could consider stochastic forcing with

\begin{equation}\label{eq:stochastic}
\begin{aligned}
\dot{V} & = \eta_1-\eta_2+\eta_3(T-V)-T-V|V|+A\xi_1(t), \\
  \dot{T}   & = \eta_1-T(1+|V|)+B\xi_2(t), \\
 \dot{\eta_2} & = -\epsilon\\
 V(0)=&V^0,\quad T(0)=T^0, \quad \eta_2(0)={\eta_2}^0,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where $\xi_i(t)$ is standard Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance $t$ and initial conditions centered on the lower branch. This is shown in figure~\ref{fig:stochastic} and it is clear a completely separate analysis is needed.
